Profile				
-------

Economics has been my favourite subject since high school. I especially like environmental economics and how to make economic growth possible in a sustainable way. My favourite thing about economics is how analytical it is and how it lets the world make more sense to me. I am driven and want to excel at everything I do. I am a team player, with great analytical skills and an eye for detail. My aim is to make differences for a better world, together with other people.
